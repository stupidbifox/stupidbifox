hello~\
i'm **KitSixtyFour**, but you can just call me **kit**

as you can see, this is the place where i throw the source code of the things i make.\
i don't make stuff as much as i used to, so don't expect much activity around here.

about myself? i'm a demiboy and bisexual, i like the [Mario & Luigi RPG](https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_%26_Luigi_(series)) series, edm music (Unison - Aperture is one of my favs), i know how to draw, and i'm a furry :3\

i'm also the founder behind [AstroNT](https://youtube.com/@astrontworkstation) and [KuroWiki](https://github.com/Axeon-Network/kurowiki)!

you can see more of me via [youtube](https://youtube.com/kitsixtyfour) and [mastodon](https://wetdry.world/@kitsixtyfour)!

current pfp is by [accelldraws](https:///bsky.app/profile/accelldraws.bsky.social)!! ^^

have a nice day!! :3
